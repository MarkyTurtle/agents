       "\n",
       "1. **Monitoring:** Continuously ingests and analyzes multi-modal real-time data.\n",
       "2. **Detection:** Flags abnormal signals indicating potential disruption (e.g., a port closure, supplier delay).\n",
       "3. **Assessment:** Simulates and predicts cascading impacts on inventory and delivery timelines.\n",
       "4. **Planning:** Automatically generates an optimized adaptive replanning strategy (reroute shipments, rebalance stock, adjust procurement).\n",
       "5. **Execution:** Enacts the plan autonomously by interacting with internal systems and external partners.\n",
       "6. **Negotiation:** AI engages suppliers proactively to onboard alternatives or secure expedited shipments.\n",
       "7. **Feedback:** Tracks the efficacy of actions taken and adjusts models accordingly.\n",

       "- **Significant Reduction in Response Times:** From hours/days of human decision-making to near-instant autonomous replanning.\n",
       "- **Enhanced Supply Chain Resilience:** Proactive anticipation and mitigation of disruptions prevent cascading failures.\n",
       "- **Optimized Operational Costs:** Balances urgency against costs via data-driven trade-offs.\n",
       "- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Adapts across industries and scales with supply chain complexity.\n",
       "- **Minimal Human Intervention:** Frees human experts to focus on strategic initiatives rather than firefighting.\n",
